## Chapter 2: Genesis Adventurer
For Genesis Mana holders, resurrect a Genesis Adventurers (mint an ERC721 NFT) from a complete set of 8 items from any of the 16 Orders. This means one Weapon, one Head Armor, one Chest Armor, etc all from the same Order (item with suffix “of ____”).

There is no wrong way to complete your collection but here are some suggestions:
Buy GMs on OpenSea and resurrect a GA yourself.
Trade GMs with others to resurrect a GA yourself.
Team up with others to pool your GMs and collectively resurrect one or many GAs and share them fractionally.
The more Genesis Adventurers you resurrect, the stronger you and/or your team will be in the games ahead.

## Notes for V2 Upgrade
* `Lost Food` typo has been corrected to `Lost Foot` (whoops)
* This contract now relies on a rendering contract allowing for further upgradability.
* TokenURI returns additional metadata viewable on OpenSea. This metadata is derived from the [LootStats contract](https://github.com/genesisproject4loot/loot-stats/tree/fcf8e160876ba9b416a'4096e7f877908ad8e33a3)
* Players can "Name" their Lost Mana using 100 ATIME
