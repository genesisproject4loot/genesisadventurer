## Genesis Adventurer
Upon collecting a perfect set of 8 Genesis Mana from a single Order, corresponding to all 8 item types (i.e. weapon, head armor, chest armor, etc), players can summon the spirit of a Genesis Adventurer and receive its Genesis Loot Bag.

Holding a Genesis Loot bag will entitle the owner to benefits and rewards, including unique access to mint projects across the Lootverse, special powers and privileges, the right to claim $ATIME for free, and more.

## Notes for V2 Upgrade
* `Lost Food` typo has been corrected to `Lost Foot` (whoops)
* This contract now relies on a rendering contract allowing for further upgradability.
* TokenURI returns additional metadata viewable on OpenSea. This metadata is derived from the [LootStats contract](https://github.com/genesisproject4loot/loot-stats/tree/fcf8e160876ba9b416a'4096e7f877908ad8e33a3)
* Players can "Name" their Lost Mana using 100 ATIME
